My long process jpournal with MySQL, Javascript 

Using node.js and mySQL I will try to create a lookup of people, their picture and profile

I have installed XAMP to load various server software.  Using XAMP I can run Apache and MySQL.  
I have MySQL listening to port 3000.  
You will need to insall express modules .. npm install express

To test if node.js with browser : 
    At command prompt run node expressNode.js and should get message server is listening 3000.  
    To test in browser go to localhost:3000
    Should see Hello from express in browser
    to kill expressNode.js .. go to command window and enter <ctrl-c>

Next I check to see if I can use expressHandlebars
I set up a subdirectory views and views/layout off of directory where index2.js sits 

In these files I have my main layout and my views html 
Of course, I had to install expressHadlebars .. npm install expressHandlebars 

Testing MySQL with in node console .. xamp MySQL server!  
Iuse phpAdmin (localhost:127.0.0.1)
to create a database named node_heroDB. 
I added a simple record 

Then node node_heroDBConsole.js
